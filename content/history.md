# History of WOSSS
The Knowledge Exchange Group (KEG) deserves credits for organizing a first workshop on software sustainability in 2015 in Berlin. The results of this workshop are published in the form of a report. This workshop was followed up by a next one (WOSSS17) in Den Hague, organized and co-sponsored by DANS and the Software Sustainability Institute (SSI) in the UK, renaming the activity as Workshop on Sustainable Software Sustainability (WOSSS). A third workshop (WOSSS19) was then co-organized and co-sponsored by DANS, SSI and The Netherlands eScience Center.
