# History of WoSSS
The Knowledge Exchange Group (KEG) deserves credits for organizing a first workshop on software sustainability in 2015 in Berlin. The results of this workshop are published in the form of a report. This workshop was followed up by a next one (WoSSS17) in Den Hague, organized and co-sponsored by DANS and the Software Sustainability Institute (SSI) in the UK, renaming the activity as Workshop on Sustainable Software Sustainability. A third workshop (WoSSS19) was then co-organized and co-sponsored by DANS, SSI and The Netherlands eScience Center.

# Character of WoSSS
In the course of the past three events, the WOSSS series of workshops has developed a distinct character of broadness, to-the-point introâ€™s to topics followed by open discussions, a three days event, including a social event (dinner) and a prepared reporting structure. The present partners involved in the organisation seek to maintain this character, as it has led to content full and useful reports.
