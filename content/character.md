# Character of WoSSS

In the course of the past three events, the WoSSS series of workshops has developed a distinct character of broadness, to-the-point introâ€™s to topics followed by open discussions, a three days event, including a social event (dinner) and a prepared reporting structure. The present partners involved in the organisation seek to maintain this character, as it has led to content full and useful reports.
