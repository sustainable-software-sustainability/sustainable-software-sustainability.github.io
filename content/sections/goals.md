# WoSSS Goals

## Goal 1: To bring together a broad range of research communities with a focus on the long term software sustainability of existing, new and future code.

### Objectives
To effectively engage with the following communities:

+ Research Software Engineering
+ Researchers who use, write or advocate for research software
+ Data Stewards
+ The cultural heritage sector (e.g. national libraries, archives and broadcasters)
+ HPC service providers
+ Those who represent large codes used in science
+ Research funding agencies
+ Policy makers with influence on research software
+ Publishers

## Goal 2: To Share best practices and case studies to cultivate cross-pollination of ideas and approaches in the research community.

### Objectives
To:

+ enable best practices presented at the workshop to be shared
+ enable Case studies presented at the workshop to be shareable
+ collected evidence to show that the cross pollination of ideas is happening
   + e.g. via a Longer term survey e.g. 6 months after workshop iterations
+ tracking how the workshops reports are being used/cited

## Goal 3: To Identify current hurdles and problems the research community is facing to make their software sustainable

### Objectives
To:

+ Tackle problems as a community
+ Identify joint strategies to tackle problems identified
+ Identify gaps where funding and/or activity is needed

## Goal 4: To inform policy related to sustainable software

### Objectives
To influence and inform:

+ the formulation of funding calls to allow the exploration of problems and the implementation of best practices identified
+ organisational policies to implement/mandate best practices identified

## Goal 5: To share terminology and definitions in the software sustainability space.

### Objectives
To share definitions and conceptualisations of software related matter. This is to guide the applicability of ideas from one area to another. This includes (but not limited to) the following areas:

+ Research software
+ Software preservation and conservation
+ Cultural heritage

## Goal 6: To become a sustainable activity
This is an internal objective of WoSSS, whereas goals 1-5 are outward facing objectives.

### Objectives
To:

+ ensure efforts and results are balanced.
+ develop a website for the WOSSS efforts and associated workshops
+ develop a way to onboard/offboard the delivery team and the oversight team at WOSSS
+ to have relevant governance documents and processes in place
