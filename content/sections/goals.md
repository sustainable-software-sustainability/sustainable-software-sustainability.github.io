# WoSSS Goals and Objectives

The Workshop on Sustainable Software Sustainability (WoSSS) is a series of international workshops addressing the challenges of preserving, sustaining and sharing software for scientific research.

Next to academic publications and research data, software is increasingly appreciated as a valuable output of scientific or scholarly research in its own right. All too often, software is not adequately preserved and quickly becomes inaccessible, which is a hindrance to the replication of research results. The investments in software development are soon lost, and data may become inaccessible if the tools to process them are no longer available. Moreover, software developers often do not get the intellectual credit they deserve.

The workshops bring together communities from both research and the heritage sector.

WoSSS aims at the following targets:

## 1: Target audience and cross pollination of ideas
WoSSS wants to bring together participants from a broad range of communities that are interested in how to deal with software sustainability, such as:

- Research software developers, ranging from professional research software engineers to researchers developing their own software, e-scientists, data scientists, etc.
- Participants from the heritage sector dealing with software preservation and sustainability (libraries, public archives, broadcasting archives, museums, etc.)
- Participants from e-infrastructures and research infrastructures, including data repositories and computing services (data stewards, data librarians, etc.)
- Participants from science policy and funding organisations
- Participants from private industry aiming their services and software products at research or cultural heritage (e.g. software companies, publishers)

WoSSS will provide the opportunity to share best practices and to present case studies from these various domains, and to exchange ideas and approaches for preserving, sustaining and sharing software.

It should be recognized that a cross fertilization of ideas among such a broad range of communities is only possible by aiming at shared terms and concepts on software sustainability. The WoSSS initiative will facilitate the formulation of common challenges and the reaching of agreement on possible solutions.

# 2: To identity and specify the issues at stake
WoSSS provides a meeting place to identify and discuss the hurdles and challenges the participants are facing to make their software sustainable. Questions to be asked are:

- What are the problems you are facing to sustain your software?
  - How to preserve and share research software?
  - How to maintain it?
  - How to make it more broadly applicable?
- Can we make software compliant with the “FAIR data principles”: how to make or keep software finadable, accessible, and reusable?
- Can we find joint strategies, that is: across communities and nations, to tackle the challenges identified?
- What solutions for sustaining software are already in place, and which initiatives are being taken?
- What gaps are there in the existing research and e-infrastructures, where funding and/or organisation are needed?
- What legal impediments (licenses, copyrights) are preventing software to be sustained, preserved and shared?
- What other questions should we explore?

# 3: To inform policy makers and funders
After Open Access and FAIR data, software as a research output worthy and in need of preservation and sharing, is only recently receiving more attention from policy makers and research funding organisations, partly thanks to activities such as those by the WoSSS communities (workshops and reports). WoSSS offers further opportunities to:

- Discuss funding opportunities and to promote consortia for the preparation of proposals related to software sustainability
- To inform policy makers and funders about the challenges and needs related to software sustainability
- To advocate the need for infrastructures and services to sustain software, and to discuss how these can be most efficiently organised and delivered, across countries and domains/communities.
- Is software sustainability represented well enough in the initiatives for a European Open Science Cloud?

# 4: Supporting activities to sustain software sustainability
It seems almost a play of words, but without an active movement software sustainability cannot be accomplished. This is why WoSSS pays attention to how to sustain and organise itself in the future:

- How can WoSSS best organise (or contribute to) future workshops that meet the needs of the software sustainability movement.
- Which other relevant organisations and initiatives on software sustainability exist around the globe, how to reach out to them and how to combine interests and join efforts?
- To develop and expand a website for the WoSSS activities and associated workshops
- How to organise WoSSS: should it develop into a standing organisation (like an association or foundation) with relevant governance and other formal processes, such as statutes, rules of procedure and a code of conduct?
