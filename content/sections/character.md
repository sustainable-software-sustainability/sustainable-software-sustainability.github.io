# Character of WOSSS
In the course of the past three events, the WOSSS series of workshops has developed a distinct character of broadness, to-the-point introductions to topics followed by open discussions, a three days event, including a social event (dinner) and a prepared reporting structure. The present partners involved in the organisation seek to maintain this character, as it has led to content full and useful reports.

An example of the broadness of the workshop is the inclusion of clutural heritgage participants such as national libraries, national archives, broadcasting heritage organisations and those involved with old film and games preservation. This is alongside the traditional research and development organisations who are focused on sustainable software.
