The three founding partners are responsible for the organization and collective funding of the WoSSS workshops. On topics in domains that are shared with the associate members, explicitly cooperation if sought on the contents of those topics and the speakers to be invited.

The Founding Partners are open to new partners, who share the goals of WOSSS and who are willing to share the burden, organizationally and financially.
