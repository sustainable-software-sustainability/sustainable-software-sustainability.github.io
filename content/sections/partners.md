The three founding partners are responsible for the organization and collective funding of the WoSSS workshops. On topics in domains that are shared with the associate members, explicitly cooperation if sought on the contents of those topics and the speakers to be invited.

The Founding Partners are open to new partners, who share the goals of WoSSS and who are willing to share the burden, organizationally and financially.

## About DANS
[DANS](https://dans.knaw.nl/en) is the Netherlands Institute for permanent access to digital research resources, DANS encourages researchers to make their digital research data and related outputs Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR). To support the research community three technical core
services are offered: DataverseNL for short-term data management, EASY for long-term archiving, and NARCIS, the national portal for research information. Next to these technical core services DANS also provides expert advice, training and certified services. By participating in (inter)national projects, networks and research, DANS contributes to continued innovation of the global scientific data infrastructure. DANS is funded by the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW) and the Dutch national scientific funding organisation NWO.

## About SSI
[The Software Sustainability Institute - SSI](https://www.software.ac.uk) is a leading international authority on research software sustainability, working with researchers, funders, software engineers, managers, and other stakeholders across the research spectrum. The use of software in research continues to grow, and the Institute plays a key role in helping the research community to help itself. The SSI have built a network of over [140 Fellows](https://www.software.ac.uk/fellows) from across research disciplines, championed research software and software career paths to stakeholders, worked with [over 70 projects to improve their codes](https://www.software.ac.uk/consultancy/consultancy-testimonials), written [guides](https://www.software.ac.uk/resources/guides) on all aspects of software sustainability read by over 50,000 people, and organised training events for thousands of learners. The SSI mission is to cultivate better, more sustainable, research software to enable world-class research (“Better Software, Better Research”).

## About the Netherlands eScience Center
[The Netherlands eScience Center](https://www.esciencecenter.nl) is the Dutch center of excellence for research software. It collaborates with both academia and industry, on the interface of e-infrastructure (computing, data), data science and domain sciences varying from climate science, astronomy, chemistry to humanities amongst others. The eScience Center has expertise in data handling, big data analytics and efficient computing. It maintains an eScience technology platform containing tools, interfaces, and libraries to deal with and extract information from large amounts of (distributed) data, requiring large computing infrastructures, high-speed networks, and high-resolution visualisation equipment. The eScience Center aims to improve the quality and sustainability of research software by promoting best practices in scientific software development and developing the skills of scientific software developers.
